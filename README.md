# Notebooks

This repository contains a curated set of Jupyter notebooks related to the work that we do at STScI. These notebooks follow a consistent [style guide]( https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/issues/2) in terms of layout/structure, coding conventions etc.

These notebooks are also under continuous integration to ensure that astronomers using these notebooks have a high level of confidence that they will work.

## TODO

Make sure what is said above is true. This project follows the principle of [README driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html), i.e. we have written the README describing the future we would like to see for this project.
